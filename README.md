Logic coded entirely in JavaScript. User interaction coded using JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

Project still in progress. The majority of functionality works, but some bugs exist with double jumps and some problems with DOM click events firing multiple times unintentionally. Work is still being performed to iron these out.
